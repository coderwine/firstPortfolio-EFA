Project Overview  

We have consulted with our Industry Advisory Board and a major component for job consideration is that a student should be able to show a list of projects that they have completed, along with easy to access information about your work history and current Github activity. Your portfolio is one link that can be provided to future employers to showcase your skills and present easily accessible information about you.

Portfolio Requirements
The following list contains the bare essential requirements that you’ll need to have in your portfolio to receive a badge from Eleven Fifty:

The site uses HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap to properly divide content and to account for a variety of devices. Bootstrap templates are ok to use, but they should be tailored in a way that is unique to you. (We shouldn’t be able to recognize the template).
The site is aesthetically pleasing overall and is tailored in a way that exhibits your unique professional personality.
The CSS styling goes beyond the minimal components (e.g., background color and font color), and provides an engaging user experience.
The site is highly navigable with its buttons. All buttons are functioning properly and even have features that accentuate the texture of the buttons.
The site has thumbnails with links that show examples of work you’ve built in this course. These will include samples or links to Repl.it projects, Codepen.io projects, your Static Layout Project, and any projects you've done in the past or on the side. Essentially, these are links that showcase your original work.
The site provides detailed information for employers to contact you, including LinkedIn and Github info/buttons.
The site also has a working contact form using Formspree.io.
The portfolio has an about feature that tells your story as a developer and professional.
The site is free of spelling errors and typos.
The site has been completed in a timely fashion.
Your resume should be included and downloadable.
The site is deployed to Github pages.
Note: If you would like to omit something on this list for any reason, please fight us in person.
